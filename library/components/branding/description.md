The full-color, gradient signature is always preferred. It should be used on a white or light background. When the full-color signature is used on a gray background, the logotype should be reversed (white.).

The gradient is set at -90 angle, pink to right, purple to left, with the gradient point set at 68%. Primary background colors are the blue and a medium grey.
